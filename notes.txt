how to exert forces???
selecting outlines a node/segment
how to reference and manage each node from
get rid of selecting segments


controls:
    hold r-click and not colliding with node/segment: wait until not holding and then create a node with a given mass proportional to the time held
    hold r-click selecting a node: create a new node at the end
    l-click and colliding with node: select node
    hold l-click and colliding with node: drag node around
    l-click and colliding with a segment: select segment
    hold r-click and colliding with a segment: same functionality as before but created in the segement
    hold "+": assign a positive force to selected node. magnitude proportinal to time held
    hold "-": assign a negative force to selected node. magnitude proportional to time held
    "Tab": if selecting a node, selects the next node; if current node is last, select the first node

logic:
    when creating a new node, add it to a node array. (subclassing node and list of nodes?)
    when creating a node on a segment, we insert the node in between the segment vertices(between each node)
    need to be able to detect when colliding with a segment or node
    each node can have a mass and gravitational pull, attracting or repulsing

node class:
    // a point. can also have a mass and a force
    sf::CircleShape shape
    vector<float> pos
    vector<float> acceleration //for when we apply forces to it
    vector<float> velocity
    float mass
    float force
    methods:
        accelerate()
        move()
        recolour(bool selected)
            //we determine if it is selected and what colour it is
            //default colour is white, positive forced ones are nlue, repulsive red
            //we add a black outline if selected

segment class:
    sf:RectangleShape shape
    methods:
        recolour(bool selected) //outlines a segment with the same rules as node::recolour()

chain class:
    //chain of nodes and segments
    vector<node> nodes
    vector<segment> segments
    float highlighted_node_index
    float highlighted_segment_index

    methods:
        draw_segment() //draws a segment from 1 node to the next
        delete_segment() //deletes a segment
        redraw() //kills all segments then repeatedly calls draw_segment() for all nodes

        delete_node() //deletes a node and redraws
        insert_node() //inserts a node into a position

        mouse_is_colliding_with_node() //detects if the mouse is touching a node
        mouse_is_colliding_with_segment() //detects if the mouse is touching a segment
        select_node()
            // chooses which node is selected and then calls its recolour method
        select_segment() //chooses which

        change_magnitude() //changes the magnitude of the force for the selected node
